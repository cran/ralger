The goal of **ralger** is to facilitate web scraping in R. For a quick
video tutorial, I gave a talk at useR2020, which you can find
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHi6E8jegQg)

## Installation

You can install the `ralger` package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("ralger")
```

or you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/ralger")
```

## scrap()

This is an example which shows how to extract firms’ denomination from
the website of the [Algerian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry](http://elmouchir.caci.dz) (CACI). For simplicity, we’ll focus
on firms operating within the capital (Algiers).

``` r
library(ralger)

my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver"

my_node <- ".listing_default" # The CSS class, we recommend SelectorGadget

scrap(link = my_link, node = my_node)

If you want to scrap multiple list pages, just use `scrap()` in
conjunction with `paste0()`. Suppose, we want to extract the above
information from the first 3 pages (starts from 0):

``` r
my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver&page=" 

my_node <- ".listing_default"

scrap(link = paste0(my_link, 0:2), node = my_node)

Thanks to the [robotstxt](https://github.com/ropensci/robotstxt), you
can set `askRobot = T` to ask the `robots.txt` file if it’s permitted to
scrape a specific web page.

## table\_scrap()

If you want to extract an **HTML Table**, you can use the
`table_scrap()` function. Take a look at this
[webpage](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW)
which lists the highest gross revenues in the cinema industry. You can
extract the HTML table as follows:

``` r


data <- table_scrap(link ="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW")

head(data)
#>   Rank                                      Title Lifetime Gross Year
#> 1    1                          Avengers: Endgame $2,797,800,564 2019

#> 4    4 Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens $2,068,454,133 2015

**When you deal with a web page that contains many HTML table you can
use the `choose` argument to target a specific table**

## tidy\_scrap()

Sometimes you’ll find some useful information on the internet that you
want to extract in a tabular manner however these information are not
provided in an HTML format. In this context, you can use the
`tidy_scrap()` function which returns a tidy data frame according to the
arguments that you introduce. The function takes four arguments:

  - **link** : the link of the website you’re interested for;
  - **nodes**: a vector of CSS elements that you want to extract. These
    elements will form the columns of your data frame;
  - **colnames**: this argument represents the vector of names you want
    to assign to your columns. Note that you should respect the same
    order as within the **nodes** vector;
  - **clean**: if true the function will clean the tibble’s columns;
  - **askRobot**: ask the robots.txt file if it’s permitted to scrape
    the web page.

### Example

We’ll work on the famous [IMDb website](https://www.imdb.com/). Let’s
say we need a data frame composed of:

  - The title of the 50 best ranked movies of all time
  - Their release year
  - Their rating

We will need to use the `tidy_scrap()` function as follows:

``` r

my_link <- "https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating"

my_nodes <- c(
  ".lister-item-header a", # The title 
  ".text-muted.unbold", # The year of release 
  ".ratings-imdb-rating strong" # The rating)
  )

names <- c("title", "year", "rating") # respect the nodes order


tidy_scrap(link = my_link, nodes = my_nodes, colnames = names)
#> # A tibble: 50 x 3
#>    title                                         year   rating
#>    <chr>                                         <chr>  <chr> 
#>  1 The Shawshank Redemption                      (1994) 9.3   
#>  2 The Godfather                                 (1972) 9.2   
#>  3 The Dark Knight                               (2008) 9.0   
#>  4 The Godfather: Part II                        (1974) 9.0   
#>  5 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) 8.9   
#>  6 Pulp Fiction                                  (1994) 8.9   
#>  7 Schindler's List                              (1993) 8.9   
#>  8 12 Angry Men                                  (1957) 8.9   
#>  9 Inception                                     (2010) 8.8   
#> 10 Fight Club                                    (1999) 8.8   
#> # ... with 40 more rows
```

Note that all columns will be of *character* class. you’ll have to
convert them according to your needs.

## titles\_scrap()

Using `titles_scrap()`, one can efficiently scrape titles which
correspond to the *h1, h2 & h3* HTML tags.

### Example

If we go to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), we can
easily extract the titles displayed within a specific web page :

``` r


titles_scrap(link = "https://www.nytimes.com/")
