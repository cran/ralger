1- Thanks to Ezekiel (ctb) I've added an argument to the table_scrap() function which is fill (the argument is from the rvest package), the user has now the ability to set fill = TRUE when dealing with tables with inconsistent number of columns/rows. 


# ralger 2.0.0

1- I've added the __choose__ argument to the `table_scrap()` function, which allows the user to choose which table to extract.

2- I've added two  functions: 
+ `titles_scrap()` for scraping titles from a website. 
+ `paragraphs_scrap()` for scraping paragraphs from a website.
